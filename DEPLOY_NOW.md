# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - 3 Simple Steps

## Your demo is ready! Here's how to deploy it:

---

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (30 seconds)

1. **Click this link:**
   ```
   https://github.com/EinInnSol/final-first-contact-e-i-s/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - That's it! Just select "GitHub Actions" from the dropdown

3. **Click Save** (if there's a save button)

---

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment (1-2 minutes)

The GitHub Action will automatically run and deploy your site.

**To watch it deploy:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/EinInnSol/final-first-contact-e-i-s/actions
2. You'll see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
3. Wait for the green checkmark ✅

## Step 3: Get Your Live URL!

Once deployed, your demo will be live at:

```
https://eininnsol.github.io/final-first-contact-e-i-s/
```

**Or find it here:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/EinInnSol/final-first-contact-e-i-s/settings/pages
2. You'll see: "Your site is live at [URL]"

## 🎉 DONE! Now you can:

## 📱 Test It:

Once live, test these flows:

**Flow 1: Guided Demo (Your Pitch)**
1. Open the live URL
2. Click "Start Guided Demo"
3. Walk through: Intake → Success → Caseworker → City Oversight

**Flow 2: QR Code**
1. Open the live URL on your laptop
2. Scan the QR code with your phone
3. Your phone opens to the client intake form
4. Submit the form

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

**If deployment fails:**
1. Make sure your repo is **public** (or you have GitHub Pro/Teams)
2. Check Actions tab for error messages
3. Try triggering manually: Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow

**If you don't see "GitHub Actions" option:**
1. Your repo might be private - make it public
2. Or use the "Deploy from a branch" option instead:
   - Branch: `claude/create-hifi-demo-01ABeQ16xeaERkuc6DzzVASY`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
