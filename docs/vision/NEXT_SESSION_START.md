## ⚡ WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY

```
Hey Claude, continuing First Contact E.I.S. deployment for Long Beach $75K pilot.

STATUS: Mutual Support Agent built (backend/app/agents/mutual_support_agent.py). 
Need to integrate into FastAPI, deploy backend to Cloud Run, then deploy 4 frontends.

CONTEXT FILES:
- docs/vision/DEPLOYMENT_KNOWLEDGE.md (complete business + technical context)
- docs/vision/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (full vision)  
- backend/app/agents/mutual_support_agent.py (the innovation)

CRITICAL: 
- All 4 portals required (federal compliance, not scope creep)
- Region: us-east5 (only region with Claude 4.5)
- Demo needs: QR intake → 4 portals → Mutual Support alert → savings shown

READY TO: Deploy backend to Cloud Run, integrate Mutual Support Agent APIs.

What's the first deployment command?
```

## 💰 REMEMBER

- **Your cost:** $575-850/month operational
- **Pilot revenue:** $12,500/month ($75K / 6 months)
- **Margins:** 93-95% during pilot
- **Post-pilot:** $1,200-1,500/month per CoC × 400+ CoCs = $5M+ ARR potential

## 📞 IF CLAUDE ASKS QUESTIONS

**"Should we simplify the architecture?"**  
NO - All 4 portals required for federal compliance (HIPAA/HUD). Not scope creep.

**"Should we use Claude AI for everything?"**  
NO - Mutual Support Agent is deterministic (math, not AI). Claude only for 5% complex cases.

**"What's the demo?"**  
QR scan → intake → Mutual Support alert → caseworker sees pairing → city sees $48K savings → admin sees audit log. 5-7 minutes.

**"What if we run out of time?"**  
Focus: Backend + Mutual Support Agent + caseworker dashboard. Other portals can be basic.

---

## 🔥 CONFIDENCE: 95%

This will work because:
1. Innovation is real (IHSS pairing solves retention)
2. Architecture is right (enterprise-grade, compliant)
3. Market is ready (400+ CoCs need this)
4. Team is committed (James will USE this as caseworker)
5. Timeline is tight but achievable
